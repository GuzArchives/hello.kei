## About

A small Progressive Web Application (PWA) made for experimenting and learning
concepts like User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX). \*Created as a personal
side project in my free time, ~~don't expect a fully scalable application or
commits conventions in general~~.

Most of the application's content is private, so in this repository, there is just
the source code for handling the interface.
